# ASV project iOS App

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. The App uses CocoaPods for managing external dependencies, thus  run

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

3. Start Xcode and have a look at the Settings `struct` in `Datastore.swift` and `Car.swift`. You probably want to edit the defaults in the source code instead of editing these settings on your phone.

4. Build and install the App to your phone!
